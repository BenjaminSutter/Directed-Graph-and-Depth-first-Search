# Directed-Graph-and-Depth-first-Search
Class project for Data Structures and Analysis
<br><br>
This project read lines from an input file that imitate class dependencies in Java. The program then created a directed graph of the class dependencies. Finally, a depth-first search was then preformed on the graph and the 
results were printed for the user to see. The program was also capable of detecting cycles and discovering unreachable vertexes.
